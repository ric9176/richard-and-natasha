Richard and Natasha met in Madrid in 2012 while he was finishing his licienciatura in Madrid and Natasha was traveling after graduate school. They quickly took a liking to each other when they were introduced by Mabi (is it any wonder she's the Maid of Honor?) who attended university in Madrid with Richard. Since then they've had a bit of a crazy journey, living together in Madrid, Madeira, Los Angeles, Cascais, Buenos Aires, Edinburgh and London!

Now the two live between Cascais and London working remotely as a web developer and a writer. They love Portugal and consider it their adopted home (they like to say Portugal adopted them), and Lisbon happens to be the first place Richard said he loved Natasha while on a trip there a few months after they met.

As a couple, they love to travel, debate politics, have long conversations with fascinating people, eat good food, drink great wine, read, play tennis, and (at the risk of sounding sappy) they love each other, most of all.

After 4 years together, Rich proposed to Natasha in Chicago, her birth city, over a bottle of champagne at the top of the John Hancock building overlooking the city's iconic views. Which brings us to the wedding!

You have all played an important part in their stories and they're so excited to share the next step in their journey with you all on October 20, 2018 in their new home country.
