# Our Honeymoon

While the greatest gift you can all give us is your presence at our wedding, we understand that some of you may want to bestow a present upon us in honor of our nuptials. We would really appreciate any donations you could give to our Honeymoon Fund aka Honeyfund.

We will be going to Cape Verde, Africa for a week after the wedding where Natasha will likely read on the beach in bliss while Richard tries to convince her to become a prolific kite surfer.

Donations will go towards our lovely hotel, the Morabaeza, to kite surfing lessons, cocktails, dinners, and our flights there. Thank you in advance for making both our wedding and honeymoon beyond memorable.
