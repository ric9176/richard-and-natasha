#FAQs

If you have a question that isn’t answered on our extensive FAQ page, please email or message either of us. But first, please read through this entire page since we have tried really hard to answer most questions we could think of in relation to the wedding and travel to Portugal.

During the week of the wedding, we will likely be hard to reach, so if you have any urgent questions, please contact Meda Sandu and Jonathan Moss, whose details are on the [Contact Us](/contact) page. They are lovely and will be happy to help.

#Wedding Q’s

##RSVP

####How do I RSVP? Will you be sending out formal paper invitations?
Please see our [RSVP page](/rsvp). No paper invitations will be sent.

####When should I RSVP by?
Please let us know as soon as possible whether you can attend.

####Can I bring a plus one?
Please check with the bride and groom prior to inviting a date. While we would love to be accommodating, we have a very strict limit on guests due to venue restrictions.

####Are children welcome?
Yes. Please let us know if your child is old enough to require a meal so we can let the caterers know. We will not be arranging babysitting.

####Can I post pictures and videos from your wedding on social media?
We would prefer that you send us your photos and videos rather than post them on social media, for privacy issues. We have opened a private instagram account [@tashandrich](www.instagram.com/tashandrich) for all the wedding pics.

If you must post on your own social media accounts, please make sure to share only with your friends, not public.

##GIFTS

####Do you have a wedding registry?
See our [honeyfund page](/honeymoon-sal-cape-verde).

##DRESS CODE & BEAUTY SERVICES

####What's the wedding dress code?
Evening wear. This means smart suits and dresses.

####Is the wedding outdoors?
The ceremony, cocktail and dance are all outdoors. The dinner will be served indoors. It can get chilly at night so bring a jacket or pashmina.

####What shoes should I wear for the wedding?
Wear whatever shoes you like, but keep in mind the palace is on a hill and we'll be dancing late into the night, so bring some comfy shoes as backups!

####Is there a hair salon at the recommended hotel?
No. If you'd like to get your hair done (or other beauty services) for the wedding, please look for hair salons in Sintra as that will be your best bet.

####Should I bring my swimsuit?
Yes! There are beaches all along the Lisbon coast and near Sintra and the recommended hotel has indoor and outdoor pools. You won’t need it for the wedding party, however.

##FOOD & DRINKS

####Will there be vegetarian options?
Yes-- for appetizers during cocktail, dinner, and snack time.

####Will there be gluten-free options?
Please let us know as soon as possible if you will require a gluten-free meal so we can let the caterers know.

####Will there be non-alcoholic beverages served?
Yes--juices, water, flavored water and soda.

####Will there be a cash or open bar?
Open bar.

##ACCOMODATIONS & TRANSPORTATION

####Where should I sleep on the night of the wedding?
See our [accommodations page](/accommodations).

####How do we get to the wedding venue?
We will arrange a shuttle to take people staying at the Pestana Sintra Golf Resort to the Palacio at 16:25. People staying in other hotels or renting cars, there is plenty of parking and you can take an uber or taxi to the Palacio without a problem. Please be sure to leave at least 30 mins to get the venue even if you are staying in Sintra, as there can often be delays on the mountain.

####How do we get back to our accommodations after the wedding?
While we will be arranging a shuttle back to the recommended hotel for stragglers at 2 am, if you’d like to leave before then, please either drive, use Uber or call a taxi--record a taxi number in your phone; you can get the number from the hotel you’re staying at.

##VENUE & CEREMONY

####What is the schedule for the wedding day?
Please visit [The Big Day page](/the-big-day).

####What language will the ceremony be held in?
While most of our guests speak several languages, the one most have in common is English (and it happens to be our native language) so the ceremony will be held in a mix of British and American English.

####Must I take the free palace tour?
No, but we recommend it since it'll give you an idea of the venue’s rich history. Guided tours of the inside of the palace will be offered after the cocktail, but before dinner, and should last less than an hour.

####Is there disabled access at the wedding venue?
Yes, for the most part, each area can be reached by elevator. For those of you with wheelchairs, please let us know in advance so we can ask the venue to make arrangements. Unfortunately, the palace tour is not disabled-friendly, however.



#Portugal Q’s

##TRAVEL

####What airport should I fly into?
Lisbon airport is the closest to the wedding venue. Sintra is just 30km (18 miles) or so from Lisbon airport and can be reached by all types of transportation. Uber generally costs under 30 euros, and a taxi costs less than 45 euros, but we recommend Uber over taxis to make sure you get the best deal.

####When should I book my flights and accommodation?
The sooner, the better. Prices always go up closer to the date.

####How do I get around?
Uber, rental cars, taxis, trains and buses are all great options. Google maps works well in Portugal and will give you public transportation options. Please note that the recommended hotel is not near public transportation so if you're staying there, you may want to rent a car for convenience (though uber is cheap and easy to use, too!)

####Do I need a visa to go to Portugal?
Those of you with American and EU (which, for the moment, includes the UK) passports will not require visas. Those of you with other passports or residencies / visas, please check with your embassies. Any Schengen visa will allow you to visit Portugal. If you require a visa please start process early to avoid disappointment

####What currency is used in Portugal?
Portugal uses Euros. For the best exchange rate, use a debit card at an ATM. Some banks have partner banks that don't charge fees. Also, credit cards are accepted about half of the time, so you will need a combo of cash and credit, or just cash (in euros).

####What is Portugal like?
It’s a magical place. But don’t take our word for it. Take a look at the country’s [official tourism page](https://www.visitportugal.com/en).

##WEATHER

####What's the weather like in Portugal in October?
Generally speaking, the Lisbon area is quite sunny in October. It can range from about 20-25 degrees Celsius (68-77 degrees Fahrenheit). That said, with climate change and all, one never knows so be sure to check the weather forecasts before traveling. Do bring a jacket for the evenings--Sintra especially can get a bit chilly at night since it's the mountains.

##SOCIAL ISSUES

####Is Portugal a safe country?
Portugal has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. That said, as in all cities and tourists locations, watch your belongings for petty theft.

####Is Portugal LGBTQIA-friendly?
Absolutely--although sadly, homophobia still happens in most places around the globe.

##EMERGENCIES

####What if I have a health emergency while there?
Portugal has universal healthcare and you will never be turned away from a hospital. However, for those of you that do not have EU passports / E-111 cards, you may want to get travel health insurance because you may still get charged. Please be sure to call 1-1-2 if you have an emergency.

####Will I be able to get prescription drugs in Portugal?
Yes, but make sure to bring your prescription. Different pharmacies have different hours, but there are some that will even be open until midnight for late night needs.

####Is it true all drugs are legal in Portugal?
All drugs are decriminalized in Portugal. This means it is totally legal to consume recreational drugs and have them for personal use. That said, OF COURSE, do not travel / cross international borders with any drugs that are illegal in most other places.

##GOING OUT

####What languages are spoken in Portugal?
Portuguese is the official language of Portugal. Spanish and English are also widely understood and spoken, but not always.

####How do tips work in Portugal?
Generally speaking, taxis and other services are not tipped. The only place where tips are really recommended are restaurants, but usually a couple of euros or change is enough (not the usual 10% or 15%).

####Can you recommend places to see and eat?
Of course! We love Portugal and we love food / giving tips so here's our list of favorite places to go:

Typical things to eat and drink while you’re in Lisbon: Vinho Verde, pasteis de nata, Duoro wine, sardines, a gelato from [Santini](http://www.santini.pt/).
