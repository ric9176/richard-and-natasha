# Pestana Sintra Golf Resort

The bride, groom, family and wedding party will all be staying at the [Pestana Sintra Golf Resort](https://www.pestana.com/es/hotel/pestana-sintra?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIi4CRmt7Q2QIVCvEbCh0Y0gLNEAAYASAAEgLeHvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). This is a large hotel with plenty of rooms, an indoor and outdoor swimming pool, sauna and spa rooms, as well as restaurant and a golf course. To get the best price available, take a look on the usual travel websites like TripAdvisor, Expedia, Booking.com, and others.

## Word to the wise

For those of you who stay at the hotel, please keep in mind that it's not very close to the Sintra village or train station, so you might want to rent a car if you stay more than a couple of days. For the day of the wedding, we will arrange a shuttle to and from the hotel for those of you who would like it, but please let us know in advance so we get a vehicle with enough space.

# Other hotels
While it would probably be easiest for wedding guests to stay in Sintra the night before and the night of the wedding, some of you may want to stay in Lisbon, Cascais or other towns. There are plenty of boutique hotels in Sintra and many types of hotels all over Lisbon, Cascais, and the general area. Uber and taxis are not too expensive to get around in, but again, you may want to rent a car. At the venue, there will be parking for the wedding.
